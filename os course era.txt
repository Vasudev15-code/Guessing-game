This Bash script will prompt the user to guess the number of files in the current directory. It will continue to ask until the correct answer is provided. Hereâ€™s an example of how the script could look:

#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Function to get the file count
get_file_count() {
    echo $(ls -1 | wc -l)
}

# Main script logic
file_count=$(get_file_count)
user_guess=-1

echo "Welcome to the Guessing Game!"
echo "Can you guess how many files are in the current directory?"

while [[ $user_guess -ne $file_count ]]; do
    read -p "Enter your guess: " user_guess
    if [[ $user_guess -lt $file_count ]]; then
        echo "Your guess is too low. Try again."
    elif [[ $user_guess -gt $file_count ]]; then
        echo "Your guess is too high. Try again."
    else
        echo "Congratulations! You guessed it right!"
    fi
done

Explanation of the code:

get_file_count: A function that calculates the number of files in the current directory using ls -1 | wc -l.
A while loop ensures the script keeps running until the user guesses the correct number.
If statements check if the guess is too high or too low and provide feedback accordingly.

2. makefile
The makefile should automate generating the README.md file with the required information.
README.md: guessinggame.sh
	echo "# Guessing Game Project" > README.md
	echo "This project was completed for a Bash scripting assignment." >> README.md
	echo "" >> README.md
	echo "## Date and Time of Run" >> README.md
	echo "$$(date)" >> README.md
	echo "" >> README.md
	echo "## Number of Lines in guessinggame.sh" >> README.md
	echo "$$(wc -l < guessinggame.sh) lines" >> README.md

Explanation of the Makefile:

README.md target depends on guessinggame.sh and will be generated each time make is run.
It contains:
The project title.
The date and time at which make was run.
The line count of guessinggame.sh.
3. README.md
This file is generated by the makefile. Do not edit it manually; simply run make, and it will produce README.md with the necessary information.
